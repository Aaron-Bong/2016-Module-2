# 1. 5. TypeScript [WIP]
## Introduction
Uptil now you have been developing in JavaScript to get an understanding on web development. We want to introduce you guys to TypeScript. We believe it would help with a lot of common errors that can arise from developing in JavaScript. Those familiar with typed languages like Java, C# will have your classes back.

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. (Superset means it behaves just like JavaScript but with extra stuff) TypeScript follows similar syntax to JavaScript with the introduction of static checking and code refactoring. You basically write in TypeScript but whats actually being run in is the generated JavaScript. This JavaScript can then still be run on any browser. 

Other supersets that exist are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Need more]

For this course, we will be going over the basics of TypeScript, converting our current code into TypeScript and finishing our website. 

### Disadvantages of JavaScript
* No type checking, is dynamically checked at runtime
```TypeScript
var number = 10.2;
number = "String value";
```
* No intellisense [Need to confirm]
```TypeScript
var number = 10.2;
numbr = -1; // undefined
```


### Benefits of TypeScript
* Object-oriented programming (OOP): work with classes and interfaces
* Optional static typing, able to specify the type of the variable 
* => Enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code
* => Helps with autocompletetion of your code, with types it can help suggest more appropriate variables to pass in to a function call


## Learning Outcomes
* Learn about the basics of TypeScript 
* Learn how to watch our TypeScript files to compile to JavaScript
* Converting our website to TypeScript
* Finishing our website in TypeScript

### Installation of TypeScript
If you haven't already got TypeScript installed, please refer back to [2. Development Environment](https://github.com/NZMSA/2016-Module-2/tree/master/2.%20Development%20Environment) under Tutorial 1, Setting up TypeScript.
Please also ensure you have your code up to date from the before module [4. REST APIs](https://github.com/NZMSA/2016-Module-2/tree/master/4.%20REST%20APIs)

## Tutorial 1: Basics of TypeScript

### Types

With TypeScript we can now give variables types, so that we can avoid passing the wrong type and record the intended type.
```TypeScript
var isDone: boolean = false;
var count: number = 42;
var name: string = "Deep Sea Dive";
```

If we do not the type we can assign it to `any`, this can happen when getting dynamic content. This also allows us to still work with any existing JavaScript.
```TypeScript
let notSure: any = 4;
notSure = "maybe a string instead";
notSure = false; 
```

And if your not familar there is the type `void` which means nothing. This is good when functions do not return anything and just do something.
```TypeScript
function warnUser(): void {
    alert("This is my warning message");
}
```

In this sample giving the function of type non-String will cause an error when trying to compile to JavaScript
```TypeScript
function greeter(person: string) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

var user = [0, 1, 2];

document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user); 
```
Look out for the errors, as the JavaScript file will still be created but in this case TypeScript will warn you.
```TypeScript
greeter.ts(7,26): Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target
```

### Interfaces
If you dont know what an interface is, it is basically a structural type that can have properties/fields (`firstName`, `lastName`) and can have methods (`sayHello`).
In TypeScript, two types are compatiable if their internal structure is compatiable. This allows us to implement an interface just by having the shape the interface requires, without an explicit implements clause.

```TypeScript
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    sayHello(): void;
}

function greeter(person: Person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}

var user = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "User" };

document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
```

### Classes
TypeScript supports class-based object oriented programming. Unlike interfaces these are concrete and can be instantiated to form "objects" while interfaces cannot be.
```TypeScript
class Greeter {
    greeting: string;
    constructor(message: string) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    greet() {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    }
}

var greeter = new Greeter("world");
```
We can then call the method `greet()` onto our `greeter` object.
```TypeScript
var message: string = greeter.greet();
```

Of course, one of the most fundamental patterns in class-based programming is being able to extend existing classes to create new ones using inheritance. In this example it is done by extends, we can also utilize inheritance by implemnting an interface.
```TypeScript
class Animal {
    name: string;
    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

class Rhino extends Animal {
    constructor() { super("Rhino"); }
}
```

`super()` is used when we want to call the parent's class method instead. Here we called Animal's constructor inside of the Rhino's constructor.


## Tutorial 2: Compilation of TypeScript to JavaScript

### 1. Create a tsconfig.json file
This defines the TypeScript project settings such as the compiler options and the files that should be included.

`File --> New File --> tsconfig.json`


Our `tsconfig.json` file will look like this,
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "sourceMap": true
    }
}
```

Now when you create a .ts file as part of the project we will offer up rich editing experiences and syntax validation.

### 2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

For demonstration purpose we will just have a simple TypeScript file, `helloPerson.ts`
```TypeScript
function greeter(person: string) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

var user = "Deep Sea";

document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);       
```

At the command line, run the TypeScript compiler:
```
tsc helloPerson.ts    
```

This will generate the file `helloPerson.js`.

It is obvious this can be quite tedious so

### 3. Creating a task to compile TypeScript files to JavaScript

Open Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`

Type in `Configure Task Runner`, press Enter to select it. 
This shows a list of templates for tasks you can choose from.

Select `TypeScript - tsconfig.json`. This will create a `tasks.json` file in the workspace .vscode folder.

```json
{
    // See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "tsc",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": ["-p", "."],
    "showOutput": "silent",
    "problemMatcher": "$tsc"
}
```

This is just running `tsc` on our files. 

### 4. To run the build task
To test our task is running, first delete the `helloPerson.js` generated from step 2.

As this is the only task in the file, you can execute it by simply pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Run Build Task). At this point you will see an additional file show up in the file list `helloPerson.js`.

So each time you want to recompile your JavaScript files from your TypeScript due to changes, `Ctrl+Shift+B`

## Tutorial 3: Compilation of TypeScript to JavaScript by watching
Its a bit tedious to Run Build Task (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) each time you want to implement your new change.

Here is how "Watching" the files can be of great help.

Run the following command in xxx

```
tsc *.ts --watch
```

This is going to monitor the folder for any changes in our TypeScript files and compile them behind the scenes.

## Tutorial 4: Reviewing Build Issues
Sometimes builds don't go that smoothly

For example this line of code in typescript will cause an error. (Our intellisense should tell us this!)
```

```

To review a reason why a build may have failed:

* This would show up in the output window (which can be opened using `Ctrl+Shift+U`) and selecting Tasks in the output view dropdown.
* You can click on the icon below to get a list of the problems and navigate to them.

## Tutorial 5: Converting our JavaScript to TypeScript
Lets tidy up our code bit while we convert our current code to TypeScript. 

### 1. MoodHandler file
Create a new file called `moodhandler.ts` in our `js` folder, this will look after our mood related functionality and hold a `Mood` class
```TypeScript
//Creating a Mood object which has the mood as a string and its corresponding emoji
export class Mood {
    name: string;
    emoji: string;
    constructor(public mood, public emojiurl) {
        this.name = mood;
        this.emoji = emojiurl;
    }
}


var happy : Mood = new Mood("happy", "http://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/a0/38/a038e6d3f342253c5ea3c057fe37b41f.png");
var sad : Mood  = new Mood("sad", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/files/Sad_Face_Emoji.png?9898922749706957214");
var angry : Mood = new Mood("angry", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/files/Very_Angry_Emoji.png?9898922749706957214");
var neutral : Mood  = new Mood("neutral", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/files/Neutral_Face_Emoji.png?9898922749706957214");


export function getCurrMood(scores : number) : Mood {
    let currentMood: Mood;
    // In a practical sense, you would find the max emotion out of all the emotions provided. However we'll do the below just for simplicity's sake :P
    if (scores.happiness > 0.4) {
        currentMood = happy;
    } else if (scores.sadness > 0.4) {
        currentMood = sad;
    } else if (scores.anger > 0.4) {
        currentMood = angry;
    } else {
        currentMood = neutral;
    }
    return currentMood;
}
```
This is just like our JavaScript from before in `basic.js` however we have introduced Mood as a class and able to type check our functions and characters. If by accident we try 
```TypeScript
getCurrMood("hello")
```
This time, we'd get an error when we try to compile to `.js`
### 2. Main file from basic
Lets create a new file called `main.ts` in our `js` folder, this will replace our original `basic.js` so we dont get confused.

```TypeScript
import * as mood from "./moodhandler";

var currentMood: mood.Mood;

// Get elements from DOM
var pageheader = $("#page-header")[0]; //note the [0], jQuery returns an object, so to get the html DOM object we need the first item in the object
var pagecontainer = $("#page-container")[0]; 
var imgSelector = $("#my-file-selector"); //You dont have to use [0], however this just means whenever you use the object you need to refer to it with [0].
var refreshbtn = $("#refreshbtn"); 
//Note: changing them all to [0] may prevent some errors when using functions linked to that variable.

// Register button listeners
imgSelector.addEventListener("change", function () { // file has been picked
    pageheader.innerHTML = "Just a sec while we analyse your mood...";
    processImage(function (file) { //this checks the extension and file
        // Get emotions based on image
        sendEmotionRequest(file, function (emotionScores) { //here we send the API request and get the response
            // Find out most dominant emotion
            currentMood = mood.getCurrMood(emotionScores); //this is where we send out scores to find out the predominant emotion
            changeUI(); //time to update the web app, with their emotion!

            //Done!!
        });
    });
});

refreshbtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
    // TODO: Load random song based on mood
    alert("You clicked the button"); 
});

function processImage(callback) {
    var file = imgSelector.files[0];  //get(0) is required as imgSelector is a jQuery object so to get the DOM object, its the first item in the object. files[0] refers to the location of the photo we just chose.
    var reader = new FileReader();
    if (file) {
        reader.readAsDataURL(file); //used to read the contents of the file
    } else {
        console.log("Invalid file");
    }
    reader.onloadend = function () { 
        //After loading the file it checks if extension is jpg or png and if it isnt it lets the user know.
        if (!file.name.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png)$/)){
            pageheader.innerHTML = "Please upload an image file (jpg or png).";
        } else {
            //if file is photo it sends the file reference back up
            callback(file);
        }
    }
}

function changeUI() {
    //Show detected mood
    pageheader.innerHTML = "Your mood is: " + currentMood.name;  //Remember currentMood is a Mood object, which has a name and emoji linked to it. 
    //Show mood emoji
    let img = document.getElementById("selected-img"); //getting a predefined area on our webpage to show the emoji
    img.src = currentMood.emoji; //link that area to the emoji of our currentMood.
    img.style.display = "block"; //just some formating of the emoji's location

    //Display song refresh button
    refreshbtn.style.display = "inline";
    //Remove offset at the top
    pagecontainer.style.marginTop = "20px";
}

// Refer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35565732/implementing-microsofts-project-oxford-emotion-api-and-file-upload
// and code snippet in emotion API documentation
function sendEmotionRequest(file, callback) {
    $.ajax({
        url: "https://api.projectoxford.ai/emotion/v1.0/recognize",
        beforeSend: function (xhrObj) {
            // Request headers
            xhrObj.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream");
            xhrObj.setRequestHeader("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", "d342c8d19d4e4aafbf64ed9f025aecc8");
        },
        type: "POST",
        data: file,
        processData: false
    })
        .done(function (data) {
            if (data.length != 0) { // if a face is detected
                // Get the emotion scores
                var scores = data[0].scores;
                callback(scores);
            } else {
                pageheader.innerHTML = "Hmm, we can't detect a human face in that photo. Try another?";
            }
        })
        .fail(function (error) {
            pageheader.innerHTML = "Sorry, something went wrong. :( Try again in a bit?";
            console.log(error.getAllResponseHeaders());
        });
}
```

Remember to relink our newly created JavaScript file (created from TypeScript compilation) back in our `index.html` and remove the link to `basic.js`
```TypeScript
<script src="./js/main.js"></script>
```
Now our code should still work like it did before, try give it a go.

## Tutorial 5: Involving soundcloud

Now lets get to fun stuff! 
We'll create a new file called `musichandler.ts` in our `js` folder, this will also reference our new `moodhandler.ts`  

At the top of the file add the following line so we can use the `Mood` class
```TypeScript
import * as mood from "./moodhandler";
```

### 1. Adding Song Class
In this file, we'll add a `Song` class to store information about the songs we will play on soundcloud.
```TypeScript
class Song {
    title: string;
    url: string;
    constructor(songtitle : string, songurl : string) {
        this.title = songtitle;
        this.url = songurl;
    }
}
```
### 2. Adding Playlist Class
We will also add a Playlist class to the same file. This will hold a collection of songs for each different mood. From this playlist we can then grab a random song depending on the `mood` given
```TypeScript
export class Playlist {
    happy: Song[];
    sad: Song[];
    angry: Song[];

    constructor() {
        this.happy = [];
        this.sad = [];
        this.angry = [];
    }

    addSong(mood : string, song : string) : void {
        if (mood === "happy") {
            this.happy.push(song);
        } else if (mood === "sad") {
            this.sad.push(song);
        } else if (mood === "angry") {
            this.angry.push(song);
        } // do a default one as well
    }

    getRandSong(mood : string) : Song {
        if (mood === "happy" || mood === "neutral") {
            return this.happy[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.happy.length)];
        } else if (mood === "sad") {
            return this.sad[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.sad.length)];
        } else if (mood === "angry") {
            return this.angry[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.angry.length)];
        } 
    }
}
```
In this case an `export` tag is added as we want to use this class outside this file.

### 3. Initializing playlist with songs. 

We then create a `playlist` object and populate it with various songs for different modes. Add this to  `musichandler.ts` file. 
```TypeScript
var myPlaylist : Playlist = new Playlist();

export function init() : void {
    // init playlist
    myPlaylist.addSong("happy", new Song("Animals", "https://soundcloud.com/martingarrix/martin-garrix-animals-original"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("happy", new Song("Good feeling", "https://soundcloud.com/anderia/flo-rida-good-feeling"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("happy", new Song("Megalovania", "https://soundcloud.com/angrysausage/toby-fox-undertale"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("happy", new Song("On top of the world", "https://soundcloud.com/interscope/imagine-dragons-on-top-of-the"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("sad", new Song("How to save a life", "https://soundcloud.com/jelenab-1/the-fray-how-to-save-a-life-7"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("sad", new Song("Divenire", "https://soundcloud.com/djsmil/ludovico-einaudi-divenire"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("sad", new Song("Stay High", "https://soundcloud.com/musaradian/our-last-night-habitsstay-hightove-lo"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("angry", new Song("When they come for me", "https://soundcloud.com/heoborus/when-they-come-for-me-linkin-park"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("angry", new Song("One Step Closer", "https://soundcloud.com/user1512165/linkin-park-one-step-closer"));
    myPlaylist.addSong("angry", new Song("Somewhere I belong", "https://soundcloud.com/mandylinkinparkmusic2xd/somewhere-i-belong"));

    // init soundcloud
    initSC();
}
```

### 4. Choose song to play based on moode
Given our mode we can then display the song and then use soundcloud to play the song, we add the following to `musichandler.ts` file
```TypeScript
export function loadSong(currentMood : mood.Mood) : void {
    var songSelected : Song = myPlaylist.getRandSong(currentMood.name);
    var track_url : string = songSelected.url;

    // change this to jquery
    $("#track-name")[0].innerHTML = "Have a listen to: " + songSelected.title;
    $("#track-name")[0].style.display = "block";
    $("#musicplayer")[0].style.display = "block";
    loadPlayer(track_url);
}
```
### 5. Setting up SoundCloud and using the player

In order to use SoundCloud we need to register and get an API key. To do so follow [SoundCloud's Register a new app](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new). 

![SoundCloud App registration](photos/sc_reg.png)

Add the SoundCloud JavaScript reference to your `index.html` file
```TypeScript
<script src="https://connect.soundcloud.com/sdk/sdk-3.1.2.js"></script>
```

We then create a function to instantiate our SoundCloud connection in our `musichandler.ts` file. (This is called when we instantiate our playlist)
```TypeScript
var myClientId = "*****PUT YOUR SOUND CLOUD ID HERE****";

function initSC() {
    // init SoundCloud
    SC.initialize({
        client_id: myClientId
    });
}
```
Here `SC` is from the SoundCloud JavaScript file. 
We then want to embed the SoundCloud player in a div named `musicplayer` in our html page. Add the following function to  our `musichandler.ts` file. (We will call this later)

```TypeScript
function loadPlayer(trackurl : string) {
    SC.oEmbed(trackurl, { auto_play: true }).then(function (oEmbed) {
        let div = document.getElementById("musicplayer");
        div.innerHTML = oEmbed.html;
    });
}
```

For further documentation about sound cloud please refer to their [API documentation](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide)

### 6. Changing code to utilize our new musichandler

#### 1. Import musichandler
In `main.js` add the following at the top of the file
```TypeScript
import * as music from "./musichandler";

// Initialise playlist and soundcloud
music.init();

let currentMood: mood.Mood;???
```

By importing the file this will allow ourselves to use functions and classes from musichandler.
Remember when we said we'd be calling `init()` from musichandler.ts later, well here it is!

#### 2. Invoke load song
Before our code didnt really do much once we added a picture, all we got was an emoticon. So lets use our `loadSong()` function from `musichandler.ts`

Add the call to `loadSong()` inside `main.ts` at the end of the function `processImage(function (file) {` (after `changeUI();`), 

```TypeScript
    // Load random song based on mood
    music.loadSong(currentMood);
```

Replace the inside of `refreshbtn.on("click", function () {` inside `main.ts` from doing nothing (giving an alert) to loading a song when we try ask for a new song

```TypeScript
    // Load random song based on mood
    music.loadSong(currentMood);
```

#### 3. Invoke load song

```TypeScript
    //Display song refresh button
    refreshbtn.style.display = "inline";
    //Remove offset at the top
    pagecontainer.style.marginTop = "20px";
```
#### 4. Add div to hold our SoundCloud player

Add the following after `<div class="btn-wrapper"> ... </div`, so we can have our songs play depending on the mode. (Provided by our `loadPlayer()` function in `musichandler.ts`)

```html
<div id="musicplayer"></div>
```
#### 5. Add some styling

Add the following to your `style.css` just so that nothing is there when we first open our website
```css
#musicplayer{
    padding:20px;
    display:none;
}

#track-name {
    display:none;
}
```
### 7. Test our new website
Now once all these changes have been made, we should be done! Once uploading a picture to determine our mode our website should look like this and play a song based on our mood.

![Finished Website](photos/web_complete.jpg)

Feel free to play around and add your songs to the list.
